# Predicting-House-Prices
**Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.**

For this project, we are going to work on evaluating price of houses given the following features:

      1. Year of sale of the house
      2. The age of the house at the time of sale
      3. Distance from city center
      4. Number of stores in the locality
      5. The latitude
      6. The longitude
Note: This program uses python 3 and these packages: tensorflow, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
